github.com, oh yeah, this will be great. Get ready to expand your horizons, people. <br><br>

Let's make an account.

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-step1.png" />

<br><br>

Choose the free option, obvs. 

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-step2.png" />

<br><br>

Your logged-in github dashboard. Don't worry about this for now, just go straight to the organization page, <a href="http://github.com/eecs330" target="_blank">github.com/eecs330</a>

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-step3.png" />

<br><br>

The "organization" page lizzb created for eecs 330. The admin has to add you to the organization in order for you to put your stuff up, but luckily she already added github user 330student (pretty coincidental, yah?)

<br><br>

Let's go to w14 - the repository to hold the HCI projects for winter quarter 2014.

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-eecs330.png" />

<br><br>

A list of all the files + folders that already exist in the repo. Each folder contains a default index.html file for your team to replace. 

<br><br>

Find your team's name, and open that folder.
<br>
Since I love a Arrested Development reference, I'm going to use Gobias-Industries as my example.

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-w14.png" />

<br><br>

The contents of the Gobias-Industries folder within the w14 repo of the eecs330 organization. Pretty exciting stuff, I know.

<br><br>

We're going to edit this index.html file, and add any other files needed here (like .css or .js files, or other .html pages).

<br><br>

Click on a file to view its source code.

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-gobias.png" />


<br><br>

We're going to edit this file to be our main .html page.

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-generic-index.png" />

<br><br>

So make sure you have your group files on hand...

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-group-files.png" />

<br><br>

... and utilize some mad copy-paste skillz to replace the contents of index.html.

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-cpskillz.png" />

<br><br>

You might notice this little comment box at the bottom. This is to describe the change that you made to the code (your "commit").

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-generic-commit.png" />

<br><br>

It's good practice to actually write a semi-useful comment and title. (PS ignore the url provided in image)

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-custom-commit.png" />

<br><br>

So now, after we commit, let's check out our page... 

<em> And I totally don't have a ulterior agenda of publicizing <a href="fb.com/nuwic" target="_blank">NU WiC</a>... </em>

<br><br>
Oh god, why is it so ugly? <br><br>

Probably beause we didn't add our CSS file.

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-try1-preview.png" />

<br><br>

Add a new file within your group's folder.

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-addpage.png" />

<br><br>

More copy paste skills.

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-css-cp.png" />

<br><br>

Good my eyes can stop bleeding now. But wait, there are supposed to be pictures on this page...

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-try2-preview.png" />

<br><br>

Using chrome inspector to figure out why my image isn't showing up. 

<br><br>
The reason here is because we didn't include the image specified in the path in the .css file in our repo.

<br><br>

I'm not sure if there is a way to upload photos without either downloading the github client, or using the terminal/command prompt. So as a workaround for this demo, I'm going to replace it with the exact url of the image.

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-style-but-no-logo.png" />

<br><br>

Locate where image is referenced in my css file.

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-replaceimg1.png" />

<br><br>

Replace with actual URL. Note the commit comment.

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-replaceimg2.png" />

<br><br>

Go back to page url. It may take a couple minutes for your changes to show up. Make sure you refresh the page!

<img class="tutimg" src="tutorial-images/gh-prev3.png" />



<br><br><br>

That's all for now - hopefully this gives some of you enough guidance to figure things out from here :)
